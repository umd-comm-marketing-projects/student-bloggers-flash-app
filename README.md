Student Bloggers 2010/2011 Flash App
====================================

This was a flash plugin to showcase the 2010-2011 Student Bloggers on the
linking page from the current students page.

Unfortunately, due to issues with inter-site DNS / hosting / shitty
communication between Communications + Marketing and ITS, we were never able to
successfully launch the page. Bummer.

The project is written in pure AS3 and was compiled with FlashDevelop (though
if we were to do it all over again I would obviously advise against flash and
opt for a JS-powered plugin instead)


## Usage / Notes

Since I built this 2+ years ago and I'm not sure if the Student Bloggers of
2010/11 are cool with their photos floating around on the interwebs, I'm going
to tentatively leave them (since they were floating around on blogs anyways)--
if this makes somebody mad, kindly let me know and I'll take them down.
